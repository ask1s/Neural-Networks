# Backpropagation
## In
We have many groups at the school, in each group a certain number of students slept before the exam, others studied all night.   
## Out
We take the average result of the estimates in the group as the result that the neural network should predict using Backpropagation.
### To do:
1. Create dataset for training;
2. Create dataset for testing;
3. Scale those datasets 0>x,y>1;
4. Define class for neural network;
5. Define inputs, outputs, neurons and random weights;
6. Define forward epoch step;
7. Define activation function;
8. Define backward function for backpropagation;
9. Define train and test functions;
10. Create, train and test new neural network;
11. Print all necessary outputs.
